## Data Source

The payroll dataset includes employee records, salary details, attendance logs, tax deductions, and benefits information. For demonstration purpose, data was manually generated with Python, in a real-case scenario, these are typically exported from HR/payroll systems and ingested into the pipeline for processing and analytics.

## Architecture

Data are passed through 3 layers:
- Landing: Tables from imported raw CSV files
- Staging: Standardized Views (Cleaned, Restructured Data)
- Marts: Final Data Model (Joined and Enhanced Tables)
